# Swim-scheme

## General view

This is an **in-progress** attempt to follow and expand on Abdoulaziz Ghuloum in his paper "An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction".

I will just use it as a starting point to experiment on some things and potentially expand on something more meaningful (to me).


## Reasoning and perspectives

Part of the things I have been "working" on during my spare time are programming language structure in general, byte-code interpretation,
efficient interpretation, Forth related threaded-code techniques, etc. Ideally I would love to see all this stuff combined in one project
(if possible).

This is a long term goal. What I have in mind would be a Forth like interpreter in a subset of Scheme as close as possible to R5RS (which is
already a daunting task).
